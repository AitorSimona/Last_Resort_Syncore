Group Formed For CITM's Project 1 subject, featuring SNK's Last Resort Videogame

Last Resort is an arcade shoot'em up released in 1992 by SNK. It was also released for Sega's NeoGeo and for PS2, PSP and Wii.
In a distant future mankind has developed the technology needed for space colonization. However, a mysterious computer virus infects the primary computer running human's first space station, causing it not only to affect its automated defenses, but to convince other humans to side with it. The computer attacks Earth so often that Earth's only hope is put into advanced spaceships wielding great firepower.

The player is in charge of one of this spaceships and also (when achieved in-game) an indestructible drone that is a shield and a weapon at the same time. Making good use of it is key in order to succeed.
